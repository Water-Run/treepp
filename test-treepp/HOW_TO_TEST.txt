tree++ Test Documentation

For unit testing, you can run the following command in the project root directory:

cargo test

The Rust code has tests integrated. All of these tests passed before release.

However, for actual functional testing, you may need to use the command-line tool treepp_test.exe provided in this directory.
Usage:

./treepp_test [directory to test]

The program will automatically retrieve the metadata of the test directory and run various treepp commands, comparing the outputs to determine whether they meet expectations.
The test program is written in Lua and packaged into an executable using luainstaller. See:
